Notes/Code for Math 420

Hello! Rob here these are some notes I take during Math 420 Math Modeling. I often include small sample code on the topics that Paul discusses

I made this git public not for an easy solution to homework but for comparing notes with people and if someone reads it that they verify it. If there are any issues or anything wrong with it feel free to email me at rgmckay7@gmail.com
